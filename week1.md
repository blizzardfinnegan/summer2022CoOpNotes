OU = Organizational Unit

Emails are through outlook, not Gmail

Main landing page is at `help.rit.edu/navpage.do`. There's a link there for accidental missed punch-ins

Slack is used for internal messaging

Generally log in with `bfdst`, the admin account should be used sparingly.

General job tasks:

1. Image computers
2. Make sure that they have the correct permissions in Active Directory
  - Active Directory and SCCM are managed through RDP to `clientmgmt`
3. Check slack/email
