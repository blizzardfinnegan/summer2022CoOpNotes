If a customer comes in with a Mac that won't boot properly, or that you need to recover data off of, there are several options available, depending on available options.

The first option is to boot to a USB drive, and manually remove the files using the ArchISO, or bulk-remove using Clonezilla. 

Some Macs refuse to boot from USB however, due to security reasons. 
In this case, use another Mac and Apple Target Mode to remove as much information as possible. 
This is done by powering off the damaged Mac, then pressing and holding  `T` while powering the damaged Mac back on. 

Note that this WILL NOT WORK using the standard USB-C charging cable, distributed with Macs, does not have enough bandwidth to transfer the data.
This requires using a Thunderbolt 3/4 cable, or a Thunderbolt 2 cable, with a USB-C adapter.
