If a customer comes in with a Mac that won't boot properly, or that you need to recover data off of, there are several options available, depending on available options.

The first option is to boot to a USB drive, and manually remove the files using the ArchISO, or bulk-remove using Clonezilla. 

Some Macs refuse to boot from USB however, due to security reasons. In this case, use another Mac and Apple Target Mode to remove as much information as possible.
