For computers that are no longer managed, there are a few things to do.

For Macs:
1. Retire the device in Apple School Manager.
2. Remove the device from MDM/Workspace One.
3. Boot to recovery. 
4. Either use the included recovery software, or an external disk to reinstall MacOS.

For Windows machines:
1. Remove the object from AD
2. Reinstall Windows, in the standard process.
