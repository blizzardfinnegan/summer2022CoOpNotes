For computers that are no longer managed, there are a few things to do.

For Macs:
1. Retire the device in Apple School Manager.
2. Remove the device from MDM/Workspace One.
3. Remove the device from CLAWS.
4. Boot to recovery. 
5. Either use the included recovery software, or an external disk to reinstall MacOS.

For Windows machines:
1. Remove the object from AD.
2. Remove the device from CLAWS.
3. Reinstall Windows, in the standard process.

If the Windows computer picks up its registry, or it has a sticker on it denoting a product key, then use that on install. Otherwise, the user is on their own for registration.
