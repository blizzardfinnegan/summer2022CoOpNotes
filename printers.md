How to add printers to a computer:

Windows:
If the computer is a College of Science computer, the print server you should use is `argon`. Otherwise,  the print  server is  `print01`. These servers can be connected by opening File Explorer and entering `\\argon` or `\\print01` in the upper bar where file paths generally go. Then, click on the printer name you need to register the printer.

MacOS:
All printers on MacOS are installed through Managed Software Center.  Simply search for the location of the printer in Managed Software Center, and install the correct printer. The prompt will say "Install requested" until the install process starts. Then, it will stay red, and download the update.
