Received computers:
- 3x Macs
- 7x 5401s
- 1x 5411
- 1x 7490
- 2x E7470s

In total, received 14/16 computers.

Issues:
- 2x 5401s, 2x E7470s, and 1x 7490 would not image initially. Several BIOS settings modified, along with partition scheme. No solution has yet been found. Gave Alan a 5401 and an E7470 to experiment.
- 1x Mac erased successfully, but will not register network to allow mounting an external boot device for network imaging. Alan is looking more into the situation.
- 2x Macs will not allow erasure. Booting to recovery mode results in a prompt to login with user credentials. "Forgot all passwords?" prompts for the user's AppleID email to send a recovery code. This is a personal email in both cases, so is not recoverable at this time.
